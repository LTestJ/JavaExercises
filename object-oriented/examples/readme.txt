Instructions 

1. For working on these exercises don't use Eclipse IDE. 
   We will use the java command line tools to compile
   and run the java code we write.

2. Each exercise will have a single file. For Example
   the first exercise is in a file called Exercise1.java

3. Let us take Exercise1 as an example of how to modify
   and run the program. Assume we are going to work
   on solving Exercise1.

   a. Get the latest from github
   b. cd into folder 'Examples'
   c. Write code to solve the task
   
      The code for Exercise1 will be file Exercise1.java

   e. Compile the code

      In the shell (by shell I mean git shell)

      $ javac Exercise1.java

      if the syntax of the code was correct, a file Exercise1.class 
      will be created. This file contains Java bytecode. Java bytecodes
      are instructions understood by Java Virtual Machine.

   f. Run the code
     
      In the shell (by shell I mean git shell)

      $ java Exercise1

      Note:- Make sure you have compiled java source file
      (i.e class file was created) before you run the code.
